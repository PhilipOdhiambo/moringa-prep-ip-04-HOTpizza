### Goal
The goal of this week's Independent Project is to help us practice and understand better the concepts that we have covered throughout this week. These include working with constructors, prototypes, objects, properties, and methods in Javascript as well as using jQuery and DOM manipulation & traversal.

### Overall Project Description
You own a pizza place and as a way of trying to widen your customer base, you decide to create a web application where your customers order different sizes of pizzas with one or more toppings. 

Be sure to give your application a suitable catchy name.

### User Stories
As a customer, I would like to;

1. Choose the size of pizza I want e.g Small, Medium, Large

2. Choose what kind of crust I would like the pizza to have e.g Crispy, Stuffed, Gluten-free
3. Choose the topping(s) I want on my pizza.
4. Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.
5. Have an option to order as many pizzas as I want.
6. Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
7. If I want my pizza to be delivered, I want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
8. See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.

### Requirements
1. Determine the prices for each pizza size.

2. Each pizza topping should have a set value depending on the size of the pizza.
3. Determine the cost for the crust
4. The total cost of a pizza should constitute, the crust, topping(s) and size of the pizza.
5. On checkout, the application displays the ordersâ€™ summary together with the total amount charged. For example, if the customer has made more than one pizza order, on checkout the application displays a summary of all the orders he/she has made and the total amount to pay for all his/her orders.

## Project Objectives
1. The project code uses constructors in Javascript.

1. The project makes use of prototypes in Javascript.
1. The project implements one or more Javascript functions.
1. The project separates the business logic code from the UI logic code.
1. The web app uses bootstrap and media queries to make it fully responsive.
1. The javascript code uses the correct syntax of camel case naming of variables. I.e var myVariable = "stores something"; instead of var my_var = "stores something", or, var MyVar = "stores something" , or,  var my-Var = "stores something"

## Technical Requirements
1. The project should contain a well-documented README markdown file.

1. The project should be visually appealing and polished in a portfolio quality state.
1. The project should contain regular git commits with appropriate commit messages associated with them.
1. The working project should be deployed and the link to the live site provided in the Github repository.
1. The project code should be pushed to Github.
1. The project code should be consistently indented, neat and easy to read through.
